### Important | Disclaimer
Some tasks have only one commit as sometimes i was too focused on solving them to distract on commits.
Sorry about them and thanks for the amazing lab, as it is was incredibly practical and now i feel fluent in linked lists.

Also, some modules contain testing `print` calls, i hope you understand that i was not seeking to be professional in my Codewars journey in terms
of clean code.
Have a great day to whoever is reading this
